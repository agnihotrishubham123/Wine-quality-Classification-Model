This challenge was from Microsoft to classify Wine Quality based on Real Data
Classification Challenge
Wine experts can identify wines from specific vineyards through smell and taste, but the factors that give different wines their individual charateristics are actually based on their chemical composition.

In this challenge, you must train a classification model to analyze the chemical and visual features of wine samples and classify them based on their cultivar (grape variety).
